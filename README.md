# Guardrail ML 

Guardrail is an open-source toolkit for building domain-specific language models with confidence. From domain-specific dataset creation and custom evaluations to safeguarding and redteaming aligned with policies, our tools accelerates your LLM workflows to systematically derisk deployment.

Guardrail ML:
1. Transforms unstructured data into JSON for fine-tuning LLMs (SFT)
2. Evaluates LLMs I/O for performance and across domain-specific tasks
3. Benchmarks LLMs across your experiments and open-source 
4. Safeguard your LLMs with aligned guardrails 
5. Redteam your LLMs with prompt pertubations

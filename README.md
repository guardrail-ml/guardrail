Guardrail ML is an open-source toolkit for fine-tuning and deploying powerful, safe, and customized large language models. Our toolkit accelerates the time-to-production of custom LLMs by transforming unstructured data to `.json` for fine-tuning and capturing responsible AI metrics of outputs/prompts to mitigate risks and improve performance. 

## Quickstart 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KCn1HIeD3fQy8ecT74yHa3xgJZvdNvqL?usp=sharing)

Get started with the below tasks in minutes via a free colab instance: 
1. Evaluate LLM outputs/prompts for Text Quality, Toxicity, Bias, Relevance, Sentiment, Prompt Injection, etc.
2. Generate JSON Question & Answer dataset from PDF leveraging LLMs
3. Log evaluation metrics to improve performance and auditing
